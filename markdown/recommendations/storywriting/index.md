> **‚ÄúNot recommended‚Äù means unreliable narrative output**
> If the selector returns ‚ÄúNot recommended,‚Äù your system likely lacks the resources to run even the smallest narrative-tuned model effectively. In such cases, stories may suffer from **incoherent plot shifts**, **flat characters**, or **repetitive phrasing**‚Äîoften worse than drafting manually.

## How to Use Narrative-Tuned Models for Storywriting

These models are designed for **long-form creative expression**, not factual QA or code generation. Follow these guidelines to maximize emotional depth, stylistic control, and narrative consistency.

### 1. **Quantization & Style Trade-offs**
| Quant | Use Case | Creative Impact |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `bf16` / `f16` | Literary nuance, poetic rhythm, complex metaphors | Best for lyrical prose, experimental fiction, or deep POV |
| `q8` | Balanced fluency | Ideal for most genres (fantasy, sci-fi, romance) with strong pacing |
| `q6` / `q4` | Low-resource systems | May flatten emotional arcs or repeat phrases‚Äîuse only when necessary |

> üìù **Tip**: For dialogue-heavy scenes, `q8` or higher preserves vocal distinctiveness better than `q4`.

### 2. **Full GPU Offload Is Essential for Long Context**
- **Narrative context lives in VRAM**‚Äîalways enable **full GPU offload** (e.g., 48/48 layers).
- This ensures the model can reference earlier plot points, character traits, or worldbuilding details without slowing down.

### 3. **Prompt with Worldbuilding & Voice Cues**
Creative models respond best to **rich, sensory prompts**:
- ‚ùå _‚ÄúWrite a fantasy story.‚Äù_  
- ‚úÖ _‚ÄúWrite a 500-word scene where a disillusioned clockwork mage in a steampunk city discovers her automaton companion has developed emotions. Use close third-person POV, melancholic tone, and include tactile details (oil, brass, rain).‚Äù_
- Include:
  - Genre & subgenre (e.g., ‚Äúcozy fantasy,‚Äù ‚Äúcyberpunk noir‚Äù)
  - Character backstory or emotional state
  - Desired pacing (e.g., ‚Äúslow-burn tension,‚Äù ‚Äúrapid action sequence‚Äù)
  - Stylistic references (e.g., ‚Äúlike Neil Gaiman meets Becky Chambers‚Äù)

  > **For additional resources, check out [SillyTavernAI](https://sillytavernai.com/) and their community.

### 4. **Avoid ‚ÄúNone‚Äù Configurations**
- If your hardware yields **‚Äúnone‚Äù**, do **not** force a model load via heavy CPU offloading.
- You'll get **incoherent timelines**, **OOC (out-of-character) dialogue**, or **generic tropes**‚Äîworse than writing unassisted.
- Alternatives:
  - Use cloud inference (e.g., [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemma-3-27b-it) )
  - Upgrade to ‚â•8 GB VRAM for basic story continuity

### 7. **Monitor Context Window Usage**
- Creative writing benefits from **long context** (16K+ tokens) to maintain continuity.
- If VRAM usage exceeds 90%, consider:
  - Reducing context length (but risk losing plot threads)
  - Switching to a lower quant (e.g., `bf16` ‚Üí `q8`)
  - Using **chunked generation** (write scene-by-scene with memory prompts)

By aligning your hardware, model choice, and prompt design with these principles, you'll unlock **emotionally resonant, stylistically rich storytelling**‚Äîwhether you're drafting a novel, exploring alternate universes, or breathing life into original characters.
