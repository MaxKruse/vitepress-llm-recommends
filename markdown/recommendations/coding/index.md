# Coding Recommendations  
**Prioritizing Very High Precision in Code Generation, Completion, and Debugging**

When working with AI-assisted coding, **precision is non-negotiable**. Even minor hallucinations, syntactic errors, or incorrect logic can introduce bugs, security vulnerabilities, or maintenance debt. These recommendations are tailored for developers who require **extremely high-fidelity outputs**â€”not just plausible-looking code, but **correct, production-ready, and logically sound** implementations.

Use the selector below to identify the best model **that balances your hardware constraints with the highest achievable precision**:

<script setup>
import ModelSelector from '../../../components/ModelSelector.vue'

const models = [
      { ramMin: 64, vramMin: 16, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'BF16' }}], usefulness: 1.0},
      { ramMin: 32, vramMin: 16, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'Q8_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0.7},
      { ramMin: 32, vramMin: 6, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'Q6_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0.5},
      { ramMin: 16, vramMin: 4, models: [{"Qwen3 4B Instruct 2507": { parameters: 4, quantization: 'F16' }}], usefulness: 0.3},
      { ramMin: 16, vramMin: 0, models: [{"Qwen3 4B Instruct 2507": { parameters: 4, quantization: 'Q4_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0},
    ]
