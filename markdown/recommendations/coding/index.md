# Coding Recommendations  
**Prioritizing Very High Precision in Code Generation, Completion, and Debugging**

When working with AI-assisted coding, **precision is non-negotiable**. Even minor hallucinations, syntactic errors, or incorrect logic can introduce bugs, security vulnerabilities, or maintenance debt. These recommendations are tailored for developers who require **extremely high-fidelity outputs**—not just plausible-looking code, but **correct, production-ready, and logically sound** implementations.

Use the selector below to identify the best model **that balances your hardware constraints with the highest achievable precision**:

<script setup>
import ModelSelector from '../../../components/ModelSelector.vue'

const models = [
      { ramMin: 64, vramMin: 16, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'BF16' }}], usefulness: 1.0},
      { ramMin: 32, vramMin: 16, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'Q8_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0.7},
      { ramMin: 32, vramMin: 6, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'Q6_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0.5},
      { ramMin: 16, vramMin: 4, models: [{"Qwen3 4B Instruct 2507": { parameters: 4, quantization: 'F16' }}], usefulness: 0.3},
      { ramMin: 16, vramMin: 0, models: [{"Qwen3 4B Instruct 2507": { parameters: 4, quantization: 'Q4_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0},
    ]

## Why Precision Matters in Coding

Unlike creative or conversational tasks, **code must be functionally correct**. A model that “sounds right” but produces broken logic, incorrect APIs, or unsafe patterns is worse than no model at all. Therefore, **favor models and configurations that maximize precision—even at the cost of speed or resource usage**.

### 1. **Use Full GPU Offload (When Possible)**
- In **LM Studio**, always enable **full GPU offload** (e.g., `48/48` layers for Qwen3 models).

### 2. **Prefer Instruct-Tuned, Code-Specialized Models**
- Only use **code-instruct variants** like `qwen3-coder-30b-instruct`. These are fine-tuned on millions of correct code examples and aligned for **semantic and syntactic accuracy**.
- Avoid base models or “thinking” variants—they lack the precision tuning needed for reliable code output.

### 3. **Context Window & Memory Stability**
- All recommendations assume a **stable ~16K context window**.

### 4. **Quantization: Precision vs. Practicality**
| Quant | Speed | **Precision** | VRAM Use |
|------|-------|--------------|--------|
| `bf16` / `f16` | ★☆☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ (**Highest**) | Highest |
| `q8` | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ (**High**) | Medium-High |
| `q6` | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ (**Moderate**) | Medium |
| `q4` | ★★★★★ | ★☆☆☆☆ (**Low - Not Recommended for Precision Work**) | Lowest |

> 💡 **For high-stakes coding (e.g., production systems, security-sensitive logic, or complex algorithms), always prefer `bf16`, `f16`, or at minimum `q8`.** Avoid `q4` unless absolutely necessary—it sacrifices too much precision.

### 5. **Prompt Engineering for Correctness**
- **Be explicit and constrained**:  
  ❌ _“Write a login function.”_  
  ✅ _“Write a secure Python FastAPI login endpoint using OAuth2 password flow, with bcrypt hashing, rate limiting, and proper error responses.”_
- **Request verification steps**: Ask the model to “explain why this implementation is safe” or “list potential edge cases.”
- **Include error context**: Paste stack traces or test failures—this helps the model reason precisely about the failure mode.

### 6. **Avoid “None” or Underpowered Setups**
- If the matrix returns **“none”**, **do not force execution** via heavy RAM offloading.
- Under-resourced inference **increases hallucination rates** and reduces logical consistency—**unacceptable for precision-critical workflows**.
- Consider cloud inference (e.g., with `bf16` models) if local hardware is insufficient.

### 7. **Validate and Monitor**
- **Never trust output blindly**. Always:
  - Run static analysis (e.g., `mypy`, `eslint`, `bandit`)
  - Execute unit tests
  - Review for logic correctness
- Monitor VRAM usage: sustained >95% utilization can cause **numerical errors** that silently degrade output quality.

By aligning your tooling with the **highest-precision models your hardware can support**, you ensure that AI assistance enhances—rather than undermines—code quality, security, and maintainability. **When correctness is paramount, precision isn't optional—it's essential.**
