# Coding Recommendations  
**Prioritizing Very High Precision in Code Generation and Debugging**

When working with AI-assisted coding, **precision is non-negotiable**. Even minor hallucinations, syntactic errors, or incorrect logic can introduce bugs, security vulnerabilities, or maintenance debt. These recommendations are tailored for developers who require **extremely high-fidelity outputs**â€”not just plausible-looking code, but **correct, production-ready, and logically sound** implementations.

Use the selector below to identify the best model for a given hardware configuration:

<script setup>
import ModelSelector from '../../../components/ModelSelector.vue'

const models = [
      { ramMin: 64, vramMin: 16, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'BF16' }}], usefulness: 1.0},
      { ramMin: 64, vramMin: 12, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'Q8_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0.7},
      { ramMin: 32, vramMin: 16, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'Q8_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0.7},
      { ramMin: 32, vramMin: 6, models: [{"Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct": { parameters: 30, quantization: 'Q6_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0.5},
      { ramMin: 16, vramMin: 4, models: [{"Qwen3 4B Instruct 2507": { parameters: 4, quantization: 'F16' }}], usefulness: 0.3},
      { ramMin: 16, vramMin: 0, models: [{"Qwen3 4B Instruct 2507": { parameters: 4, quantization: 'Q4_K_XL' }}], usefulness: 0},
    ]

</script>

<ModelSelector :modelDefinitions="models" />

# Prompting

To effectively prompt coding models in a chat-based interface, consider the following guidelines:

1.  **State your goal clearly.** Provide context for your request. An authoritative tone often yields better results.
2.  **Use code blocks.** Enclose any code, error messages, data structures, or formatting examples within markdown code blocks for clarity.
3.  **Provide examples.** Include relevant code snippets or data samples to illustrate your request.

Below are some examples of well-structured prompts, followed by examples of what to avoid.

## Effective Examples

### Generating a Function

This prompt clearly defines the input data structure and the desired outcome.

````md
Write a JavaScript function that generates a descriptive sentence about a person, given an input object with the following structure:

```ts
type Status = "dead" | "alive";

interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  status: Status;
}
```

The function should return a grammatically correct sentence.
````

### Requesting Debugging Help

This prompt provides both the error and the code that produced it, creating a complete context for the model.

````md
I have encountered this error:

```
Error: Cannot divide by zero
```

In the following JavaScript code:

```js
function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
  }
  return a / b;
}
```

Can you help me refactor the error handling to be more user-friendly?
````

## Poor Examples (What to Avoid)

The following prompts are less effective because they lack necessary context, formatting, and clarity, forcing the model to guess.

### Vague Function Request

This prompt lacks structure and mixes the data description with the instruction.

````md
make a js function. it takes a person with a name, age, and status (dead or alive) and it should make a sentence about them.
````

**Why it's ineffective:**

*   **No Code Formatting:** The description of the `Person` object is not in a code block, making it harder to parse.
*   **Ambiguous:** The request "make a sentence" is vague and leaves too much room for interpretation.
*   **Lacks Authority:** The tone is casual and less direct, which can sometimes lead to less precise results.

### Incomplete Debugging Request

This prompt mentions an error but provides no code, making it impossible to solve.

````md
My code is broken. It gives me a "cannot divide by zero" error. How do I fix my code?
````

**Why it's ineffective:**

*   **No Code Context:** Without the relevant code, the model cannot identify the source of the error.
*   **No Error Formatting:** The error message is not placed in a code block, blending in with the rest of the text.
*   **Too Broad:** "How do I fix my code?" is an unanswerable question without seeing the code in question.
