# Model Types

Modern AI systems leverage different architectural approaches to balance performance, efficiency, and capability. This section explores two fundamental model paradigms:

## Dense Models
**Traditional, unified architectures** where every parameter participates in every inference.

- Consistent computational requirements
- Simpler training and deployment

## Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
**Sparse, conditional architectures** that activate specialized sub-networks ("experts") based on input.

- Dynamic computational scaling
- Specialized knowledge routing
