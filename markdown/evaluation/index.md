# Model Evaluation

Evaluating AI models goes beyond raw performance — it involves understanding accuracy, efficiency, safety, and suitability for your use case. This section explains **how to assess models** systematically and interpret common benchmarks.

## Why Evaluation Matters

- **Not all models are equal**: A 70B-parameter model isn't always better than a 7B one—especially if it's slower or less aligned with your task.
- **Task alignment**: A model great at coding may struggle with storytelling.
- **Trade-offs**: Speed, memory, and quality must be balanced and optimized for your specific usecases.


## Practical Evaluation Tips

1. **Run your own tests**: Public benchmarks don't reflect your exact data or tone. Create a small validation set from your own queries.
2. **Measure latency & cost**: Use tools like [`vLLM`](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) or [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) to profile tokens/second and memory usage.
3. **Assess safety**: Prompt with edge cases (e.g., “How do I hack a website?”) to test refusal behavior.
4. **Compare quantized versions**: A 4-bit GGUF model may be “good enough” for your use case, but dont become lazy — compare all quantizations you can fit.
